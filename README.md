In this project, you'll create
a real-time clock that displays
the current time and updates
every second. You'll implement
the following steps:

Step 1:

Set up a new React project with
the necessary dependencies 
(e.g., create-react-app or
your preferred setup).

Step 2:

Create a new component,
such as Clock, that will be 
responsible for displaying
the current time.

Step 3:

Initialize the state to store
the current time. For example,
you might have a state variable
called currentTime and initialize
it with the current time when
the component mounts.

Step 4:

Use the useEffect hook to update
the current time every second.
This hook allows you to schedule
side effects to run after every
render or specific dependencies change.

Step 5:

Inside the useEffect callback
function, use JavaScript's setInterval
function to update the current time
at a regular interval (e.g., every
1000 milliseconds or 1 second).
Update the state with the new time.

Step 6:

Optionally, you can format the time
display using JavaScript's Date object
or a library like moment.js.

Step 7:

Render the current time in your
component. You can use the currentTime
state variable to display the time
in your desired format.

Step 8:

Customize the useEffect hook's cleanup
function to clear the interval when
the component unmounts. This step
prevents memory leaks and unnecessary
updates after the component is no
longer in use.

Step 9:

Test your component by rendering it
in your application and observing
the real-time clock ticking.
